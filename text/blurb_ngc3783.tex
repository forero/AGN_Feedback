\subsection*{Some general considerations}
The sizes of the HIP, MIP and LIP in units of the Schwarzchild radius
$R_s=2GM_{BH}/c^2$ are $R_{HIP}= (0.003-2.5)\times 10^3$ $R_S$,
$R_{MIP} = (0.057-4.8)\times 10^2$ $R_S$and $R_{LIP}=(0.25 -
2.8)\times 10^4$ $R_S$. Furthermore, following Krongold we estimate
the line-of-sight thickness given by $\Delta R\sim N_{H}/n_H$, and the
relative value $\Delta R/R$. Using the approximation for a fully
ionized gas of solar abundance on gets $\Delta R/R=1.23N_H (n_e
R^2)^{-1/2} (n_e)^{-1/2}$. In this case we obtain $(\Delta R/
R)_{HIP}=(0.001-1)\times 10^{-3}$, $(\Delta R/ R)_{MIP}=(0.04-5)\times
10^{-5}$ and $(\Delta R/ R)_{LIP}=(0.2-2)\times 10^{-4}$. These values
are in a good agreement with the results found for FeLoBALs (BAL
systems with features measured in the low ionization states of iron),
although in our case this corresponds to a system with a modest black
hole mass $\sim 10^7$ M$_{\odot}$. 

\subsection*{Implications for AGN feedback models}
Here we comment on the potential implications of the values found for
the warm absorber winds in driving the evolution of its host galaxy
NGC3783. Our objective is not to derive a physical model for the
winds, but instead discuss the values obtained in the context of
recent theoretical developments on the physics of AGN feedback. We
now present three relevant facts derived from our observations to
present this discussion.


The first relevant fact derived from our results is that the location of the
different ionization regions, $R$, are close to the black hole with
distances less than a few thousands $R_S$. This is a hint that the
physics of this region are dominated by winds driven by the accretion
disc around the black hole \cite{Murray1995}. The second fact is that
the sizes of these regions $\Delta R$ with respect to their location
is very narrow, on the order of $\Delta R/R\sim $10$^{-5}$. The third
important fact is that the mean values of the kinetic luminosities and the
momentum fluxes computed over all the lines are on the order of
$\dot{E}_k/L_{\rm bol}= (2-8)\%$ and $\dot{P}/(L_{\rm bol}/c)\sim 0.5
-2 $, this is presented in Figure \ref{fig:ep_values}, where we have
used a value of $L_{\rm bol}=1.5\times 10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$
\cite{Netzer2003}. 
                              


Recently \cite{Faucher-Giguere2012} interpreted these two facts, in
the context of FeloBALs, adducing a physical mechanism where the AGN
blast impacts moderately dense interstellar gas clumps along the line
of sight, fragmenting the clumps and sweeping them along the hot
blast. From these model they predict values for the kinetic
luminosities and the momentum fluxes of the order of $\dot{E}_k/L_{\rm
bol}= (2-5)\%$ and $\dot{P}/(L_{\rm bol}/c)\sim 2-15$. Other models
such as the cold thin shell approximation predict order of magnitude
lower values for the kinetic luminosities.
